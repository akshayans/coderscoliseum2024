            <p>Each year, 8 million tonnes of plastic pollution enter the oceans from land globally. Debris in the ocean is a big threat to marine life.</p>
            <p>Marine creatures either ingest or become entangled in plastic and more, and that leads to death or injuries.</p>
            <p>It's not just plastic, though. It can be papers, metals and woods. Some electronic devices end up in the ocean as well.</p>
            <p>There have been machines created to help with the process of this.</p>
